# niblscripts
mIRC and HexChat IRC Scripts to use on #NIBL.

# nibl.mrc
The latest version of nibl.mrc has some requirements.
Make sure you grab the "includedRequirements" folder with all of it's contents.
You can also use the niblloader.mrc file and load that to load both nibl.mrc and JSONFormIRC.mrc

# nibl-original.mrc
This is version 0.3 of nibl.mrc.  It's a little old and outdated, but we're leaving it in for those that want to use the window (non dialog) based version.

# xdccfilter
These xdcc filters are to clean up all the bot spam and display them elsewhere, cleaning up #nibl for your viewing pleasure.
